# Can You Hear Me? Automatic Speech Recognition Pipeline for Distress Intelligence.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of an AI solution for a critical use case: deploying a scalable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) microservice, finetuning it for high accuracy, and building an advanced intelligence layer for urgent hotword and semantic detection.

# Project Lifecycle and Deliverables
The project follows the complete AI service lifecycle for the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Pipeline, with each phase delivering a critical component.

| Phase | Directory | Goal | Key Deliverables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Deployment** | `deployment/` | Host the base ASR model as a scalable microservice. | **Docker Image** with the respective inference endpoint. |
| **2. Finetuning** | `train/` | Optimize the model's accuracy using the Common Voice dataset. | Custom finetuned model weights. |
| **3. Evaluation** | `eval/` | Quantify performance gains and outline the strategic roadmap. | **Comparison** detailing baseline vs. finetuned performance. |
| **4. Post-Processing** | `postprocessing/` | Transform raw transcripts into actionable intelligence. | **Detection results** enhanced with **AI-powered similarity** analysis. |

# Project Overview
- Phase 1: Deployment 
    - To establish the foundational infrastructure by hosting the base ASR model as a scalable microservice and outputting a reliable Dockerized API.
    - Created a lightweight web service with a primary inference endpoint for audio transcription, then containerize it for consistent deployment.
- Phase 2: Finetuning 
    - To improve model performance by finetuning the base ASR model on custom data.
- Phase 3: Evaluation 
    - To quantify the model's performance gains against the baseline model.
    - Compared the finetuned model against the baseline model using quantitative and qualitative analysis and propose future improvements.
- Phase 4: Post-Processing and Intelligence 
    - To supplement an intelligence layer to filter critical information.
    - Performed both exact string matching for specific hotwords and advanced semantic similarity analysis using an BERT embedding model.
